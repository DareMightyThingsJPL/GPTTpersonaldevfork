0.3.0
- Rework of several sections of the tree:
	- Habitation and lab section extensively reworked and expanded, now more cleanly split into hab, inflatable/centrifuge, life support/agriculture, and lab lines
	- Extended the Cryo branch with an extra lift/vac pair and generally reduced entry price
	- Tied the parachute techs, EVA, and inflatables together and added a rigid airships tech (I'll figure out how to give it the proper rdicon later)
	- General price tweaks
		- Moderate increase of later midgame tech costs to somewhat counter the science return spike that comes with crewed landings
		- Spiked universal docking cost just so you get a bit more time with the nice early BDB ports
		- Should now be no tech costs equal to the R&D level limits in either stock or Buruaecracy, avoiding the slight UI bug that causes
- Added mod support:
	- Mk-33: Generally distributed across huge airframes, gigantic tanks, and huge construction. Tyrannosaur stuck in air-augmented rockets where it doesn't totally make sense but gives it a bit more unlock cost.
	- X-20 Moroz: Mostly goes in supersonic flight
	- Kerballoons: unlocked at start, upgrades in fabric techs
	- Hooligan Labs: unlock in fabric techs and rigid airships
	- Heisenberg Airship Parts: gets a rigid airship tech, though a lot of ancillary parts unlock in airframes and habs; may need to revisit if I ever do pathfinder
- Other tweaks
	- Moved some of the Gemini RCS moved back to first RCS tech, because even if they're a tad over-efficient for it I don't want to force people to study ahead just to get nice complete Gemini pods
	- Slightly rearranged MMSEV wind turbines, tiny vertical turbine goes into first tech as a low-power but reliable option, big conventional turbine goes in second tech.
	- Tracked down a few extra loose PBI and MKS parts

0.2.5
- Added mod support:
	- Habtech 2: Doesn't work super well because it lacks much life support function and a lot of parts are essentially aesthetic, but distributed it as best I could.
	- Missing History: May have to check again for upgrades or whatever
	- Throttle Controlled Avionics: All in avionics, not certain how good the balance is
- Balance:
	- Shifted some of the BDB, SSPX, and MMSEV hab endcap and adapter parts to unlock earlier, Modular Station Parts is now more specifically dedicated to hubs, tubes, and airlocks.
	- Swapped the regular and interplanetary BDB Hokulani wet workshops that I'd placed the wrong way round (interplanetary goes in agriculture)
	- Moved the BDB SIB tank down to Large Tanks because it is indeed a tad inefficient for its size compared to other Saturn tanks
	- Breaking Ground Experiment Control module moved back to EVA
	- Moved BDB Banyan NTR into Nuclear Aerospike
	- Reduced cost of Deep Space Astronomy given that there's not much in there so far
	- Reduced FTL tech cost a bit
- Fixes:
	- Added patch for BDB contracts to fix tech requirements, a lot might not work great because of when science parts unlock but they will at least appear now
	- Added mechjeb upgrades patch, should unlock functions through avionics
	- Adjusted bonvoyage patch, all unlocks should be properly in avionics now

0.2.4
- Added mod support:
	- Artemis Construction Kit
	- Blushift: First to use the FTL tech
	- CryoEngines Extension: crowds the end cryogenic engines techs a bit, but they fit well enough
	- Internal RCS
	- NRAP
	- Radial Heat Shields: all just go in the heat shield tech
	- Smart Parts Continued: mostly distributed in avionics
- Fixes:
	- Tracked down a lot of dual-mod compatibility parts (DMagic, US2, KPBS, KIS, KAS, TAC-LS)
	- Tidied up node spacing a bit because the LFO line was bothering me
	- Added patch for the WBI sas upgrades
	- Moved the misplaced TS-37 separator

0.2.3
- Added mod support:
	- Boring Crew Services: airbag placed in advanced parachutes for now, will need to consider a more general approach for balloons and inflatables eventually
	- TAC Life Support first pass: parts added, not sure how the overall balance plays yet
- Attempted to get unsupported parts upgrades to go in Lost and Found, not sure it works great so far.
- Adjusted patch ordering to get it to play nice with KCT, you still get some logspam the first time you research a tech in a new save, but it clears with the next scene change.

0.2.2
- Switched the id of starting node back to 'start' to fix issues with part unlocking and adjusted stock nodes patch accordingly

0.2.1
- Properly updated the main parts patch for Knes and CNAR compatibility
- Implemented AlexSkylark's adjustments and new lost and found node in place of having the stock nodes sitting on the left side of the tree
	- anyone wanting to make a patch note that I've also added the gptt_exclude node to hold parts not intended to appear in the tree (so they don't end up in lost and found), which then gets removed before gameplay.
- Added the Sterling wind turbine, but will need to revisit the other World Power parts later.

0.2
- Added mod support:
	- Knes: Mostly works quite well with some good early rockets, but a few odd parts; overpowered rcs units placed in Electric Engine Concepts on the logic that we could imagine they're resistojets?
	- Completely NonAgressive Rockets: Provides some good early rockets, though the command parts don't quite fit.
- Fixes:
	- Moved a number of NFT and RLA pod parts accidentally placed in the capsules line to avionics
	- Switched Wind Power to depend on Power Storage rather than the reverse.
- Balance:
	- Shifted around some of the BDB Leo service module parts: those with crew capacity are moved into Orbital modules (as well as the Kane service module for now), the rest into Advanced RCS. Still not totally happy having USI life support recyclers available so early, but don't want to make them inaccessible at the point you're using the Leo capsule, might look into patching in a part upgrade for that.
	- Moved the BDB TNSS-5BN power and comms section from Solar Power to Orbital Relays
	- DMagic Soil Moisture Sensor moved to Solar System Relays, the experiment is just a free bonus now I suppose.
	- DMagic Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons moved to Surface Geology, I did not notice it was a surface-only experiment.
	- BDB Micro Goo Radiometer moved to Instrument Miniaturization
	- BDB Radek-716 moved to Space Environment Research and MRNR-340 moved to Radiation Studies
	- Lynx Drill moved to Resource Extraction
	- BDB BE-SLR227 reflector moved to Gravimetry
	- Halved the costs for Oceanic Exploration and Exooceanography given that they're both a bit part-bare so far.
